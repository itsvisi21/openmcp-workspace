"Create an open-source project called openmcp-workspace, a centralized MVP for a Contextual Memory Manager dashboard for AI workspaces. It should be designed to support a future Web4 upgrade with decentralized storage, smart contract writes, and distributed MCP read mesh. Scaffold a monorepo structure with three apps (dashboard, backend, mcp-server) and three libraries (llm-adapter, context-sdk, storage-adapter). frontend should be in react and rest is in python/solidity. Set up Feature One: manual_context_commit, including all needed backend, UI, LLM routing, and data storage (PostgreSQL + S3). Use DevOps principles: prepare Docker setup, GitHub Actions CI, .env templates, test suite, and agent-ready documentation. Include:

project.status.json to track every created/updated/deleted file with timestamps and feature tags.
backlog.json, current_applied_action.log to hold prioritized, trackable feature descriptions and development stages reporting current status at every chat closure.
docs/ folder with:

architecture.md,
agent-protocol.md,
features/manual_context_commit.md,
and upgrade plan for full decentralization.
MCP-compatible server exposing JSON-RPC endpoint for reading context from centralized storage.
Modular design for replacing centralized storage with IPFS and smart contracts later.
Local and cloud-configurable LLM access for workspaces.
Follow-up ready project layout: agent should always read project.status.json and latest context window before working on any task.
Scaffold all backend and frontend interfaces for Feature One and ensure that all logic is documented, testable, and incrementally extensible by autonomous agents or human devs."**

It sets up the entire ecosystem with foresight for decentralized evolution.
Forces modular thinking (apps/libs separation).
Includes agent awareness through project.status.json and backlog.json.
Enables true agent-driven follow-up with tracked context history.
Implements modern DevOps and CI/CD with feature-driven planning.
Builds in smart contract + IPFS upgrade slots from day one.
