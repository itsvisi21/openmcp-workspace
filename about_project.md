# OpenMCP Workspace: Contextual Memory Manager for AI Workspaces

## Project Overview
OpenMCP Workspace is an innovative open-source project designed to serve as a centralized MVP (Minimum Viable Product) for managing contextual memory in AI workspaces. The project provides a sophisticated dashboard interface that enables efficient management of AI context and memory, with a forward-looking architecture that supports future Web4 upgrades including decentralized storage, smart contract integration, and distributed MCP (Memory Context Protocol) read mesh.

## Core Architecture
The project is structured as a monorepo with the following components:

### Applications
1. **Dashboard**: A React-based frontend application providing an intuitive interface for managing AI contexts
2. **Backend**: Python-based server handling core business logic and API endpoints
3. **MCP-Server**: Specialized server exposing JSON-RPC endpoints for context management

### Libraries
1. **LLM-Adapter**: Interface for managing different LLM providers and configurations
2. **Context-SDK**: Core library for context management and manipulation
3. **Storage-Adapter**: Flexible storage interface supporting multiple backends

## MCP Fundamentals and Current Implementation

### Core MCP Concepts
The Memory Context Protocol (MCP) is built on three fundamental principles:

1. **Context Persistence**
   - Maintains AI conversation history and context across sessions
   - Enables long-term memory for AI interactions
   - Preserves decision-making rationale and reasoning paths

2. **Context Retrieval**
   - Smart context window management
   - Relevance-based context selection
   - Hierarchical context organization

3. **Context Evolution**
   - Incremental context updates
   - Version control for context changes
   - Context relationship mapping

### Current Implementation Showcase

#### Manual Context Commit Feature
The current implementation demonstrates MCP fundamentals through the manual context commit feature:

1. **Context Capture**
   - Users can manually capture and store important AI interactions
   - Context is stored with metadata (timestamps, tags, relationships)
   - Supports both structured and unstructured data

2. **Context Organization**
   - Hierarchical storage in PostgreSQL
   - Tag-based categorization
   - Relationship mapping between contexts

3. **Context Retrieval**
   - JSON-RPC endpoints for context access
   - Smart context window management
   - Relevance-based context selection

4. **Context Evolution**
   - Version tracking of context changes
   - Audit trail of context modifications
   - Relationship tracking between context versions

### Practical Demonstration
The current implementation serves as a practical demonstration of MCP concepts:

1. **Storage Layer**
   - PostgreSQL for structured context storage
   - S3 for large context objects
   - Prepared for future IPFS integration

2. **Access Layer**
   - JSON-RPC interface for context access
   - Role-based access control
   - Context versioning and history

3. **Management Layer**
   - Dashboard for context visualization
   - Context relationship mapping
   - Version control interface

This implementation provides a concrete foundation for understanding how MCP can be applied in real-world scenarios, particularly in healthcare and finance where context management is crucial.
