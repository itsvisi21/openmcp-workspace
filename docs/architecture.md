# OpenMCP Workspace Architecture

## Overview
OpenMCP Workspace is a Contextual Memory Manager dashboard designed for AI workspaces, with a planned evolution path towards Web4 decentralization. The system is built as a monorepo with three main applications and three supporting libraries.

## Implementation Status

   - ‚ö†Ô∏è ContextHistory component (0% coverage)
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Layout component (50% coverage)
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è NotFound component (0% coverage)
   - üîÑ Test framework setup complete
   - üîÑ Coverage reporting configured

2. **Libraries** - 23% test coverage
   - ‚úÖ Core library functionality (100% coverage)
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è AWS client (0% coverage)
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è LLM client (0% coverage)
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Monitoring client (0% coverage)
   - ‚úÖ 15 test cases implemented
   - ‚úÖ Async test support configured

3. **MCP Server**
   - üîÑ API endpoints in progress
   - ‚úÖ Dependencies updated
